## Reflection Document

### HTML

Note: I had somehow either missed or forgotten that I needed to do lab exercises,
so this didn't get done until week 7.

I mostly did these exercises on my own, but did cross-reference with the videos
to make sure I got everything right. I also had to look up documentation a lot.

Since I didn't do this until after the first 2 homeworks it wasn't as helpful,
but it definitely would have been very helpful for said homeworks if I had done it on time.
In particular, the form exercise would have been very nice.

It's hard to say how much of this I might have wanted explained better
or what other exercises might have been helpful since I didn't do this
until I already had a stronger grasp on the subject.

### Accessibility

Note: As with above, this was completed week 7

I did some of this exercise on my own, but found I had missed a lot when referencing the video.

This exercise was quite helpful overall and showed me some extra things to look out for,
even after completing some of the homeworks.

I think it would have been nice if there were more of these exercises, it seems like
a lot of this comes from knowing what tags exist, and I'm still likely to miss out
on better options that I don't know about or forget about ones I do.
