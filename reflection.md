## Reflection Document

### HTML

Note: I had somehow either missed or forgotten that I needed to do lab exercises,
so this didn't get done until week 7.

I mostly did these exercises on my own, but did cross-reference with the videos
to make sure I got everything right. I also had to look up documentation a lot.

Since I didn't do this until after the first 2 homeworks it wasn't as helpful,
but it definitely would have been very helpful for said homeworks if I had done it on time.
In particular, the form exercise would have been very nice.

It's hard to say how much of this I might have wanted explained better
or what other exercises might have been helpful since I didn't do this
until I already had a stronger grasp on the subject.
