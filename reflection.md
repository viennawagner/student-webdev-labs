## Reflection Document

### HTML

Note: I had somehow either missed or forgotten that I needed to do lab exercises,
so this didn't get done until week 7.

I mostly did these exercises on my own, but did cross-reference with the videos
to make sure I got everything right. I also had to look up documentation a lot.

Since I didn't do this until after the first 2 homeworks it wasn't as helpful,
but it definitely would have been very helpful for said homeworks if I had done it on time.
In particular, the form exercise would have been very nice.

It's hard to say how much of this I might have wanted explained better
or what other exercises might have been helpful since I didn't do this
until I already had a stronger grasp on the subject.

### Accessibility

Note: As with above, this was completed week 7

I did some of this exercise on my own, but found I had missed a lot when referencing the video.

This exercise was quite helpful overall and showed me some extra things to look out for,
even after completing some of the homeworks.

I think it would have been nice if there were more of these exercises, it seems like
a lot of this comes from knowing what tags exist, and I'm still likely to miss out
on better options that I don't know about or forget about ones I do.


### CSS

Note: as with above, this was completed on week 8

I did bits of these exercises on my own, but often while following along with the video.
I was able to work ahead of the video sometimes, however.

These were pretty helpful all around for nailing down my CSS. The media queries one especially
was very good practice on a lot of things.

I think everything was explained fairly well and the exercises were largely enough.
It always helps to have more practice, but there comes a point where that's no longer
lab exercises, so this was fine.

### Flex

Note: Again, completed week 8

I did this basically on my own, but checked my answers with the video largely because I was 
unclear on what actually constituted as completing the exercise.

This was reasonably helpful for understanding flex, though at this point I think I have
a decent grasp on it already. It would have been very helpful if I had done it on time, 
however.

I was a little unclear on what the assignment was actually asking of me, but the content has
all been explained nicely in class. These exercises I think were pretty sufficient for the
content as well.
